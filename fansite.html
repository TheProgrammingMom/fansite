          <p>The modern Olympic Games or Olympics (French: Jeux olympiques) are leading international sporting events 
          featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate 
          in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more 
          than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games 
          alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.</p>
          <p>Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games (Ancient Greek: Ὀλυμπιακοί Ἀγῶνες), which were held 
            in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International 
            Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896. The IOC is the governing body of 
            the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.</p>
            <p>The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic 
              Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports, the Paralympic 
              Games for athletes with a disability, the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18, the five Continental games 
              (Pan American, African, Asian, European, and Pacific), and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the 
              Olympic Games.</p>

                    <p id="flojoBio">Born December 21, 1959 – September 21, 1998, also known as Flo-Jo, was an American track and field athlete. She is considered 
                        the fastest woman of all time based on the fact that the world records she set in 1988 for both the 100 m and 200 m 
                        still stand. During the late 1980s she became a popular figure in international track and field because of her record-setting 
                        performances and flashy personal style. Griffith-Joyner qualified for the 100 m 1980 Olympics, although she did not actually 
                        compete due to the U.S. boycott. She made her Olympic debut four years later, winning a silver medal. At the 1988 U.S. 
                        Olympic trials, Griffith set a new world record in the 100 m. She went on to win three gold medals at the 1988 Olympics.
                        In February 1989, she abruptly retired. After her retirement from athletics, Griffith-Joyner remained a pop culture figure 
                        through endorsement deals, acting, and designing. She died in her sleep as the result of an epileptic seizure in 1998 at the age of 38.</p>
